. Project Description:
The Snake Game is a classic and highly engaging arcade-style game that has entertained players for decades. In this project, we implement a version of this game using Java Applet and AWT libraries. 
The game features a snake that moves continuously across the screen, controlled by the arrow keys. The main objective for the player is to guide the snake to eat randomly appearing food items on the screen.
Each time the snake consumes food, it grows in length, making navigation increasingly difficult. The challenge lies in preventing the snake from colliding with the walls or its own body, which results in a game over.
This project combines animation, real-time controls, and game logic to deliver a complete and functional gaming experience.
